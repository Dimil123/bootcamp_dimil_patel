# Nifty 50 Futures Replication & Slippage Model (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
The **Head of Index Hedging** is constrained by positional limits on Nifty 50 futures and seeks to replicate 15,000 contracts via constituent stock futures. The model will quantify replication **slippage**, the gap between the synthetic basket and actual index futures—using real-world base weights.

## Stakeholder & User
- **Decision-maker:** Head of Index Hedging  
- **End users:** Hedging team, quant analysts, execution desks  
- **Workflow:** Daily replication assessment and what-if simulations

## Useful Answer and Decision
- **Descriptive:** Time series of replication spread and slippage metrics  
- **Predictive:** Forecast replicating slippage under changing market conditions  
- **Causal:** Analyze how weight drift and constituent volatility affect slippage  
- **Artifact:** Python module that returns slippage


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Base weights set to realistic placeholders (e.g., HDFC Bank ~13%, ICICI Bank ~9%, Reliance ~8.8%, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- No rebalancing—weights fixed throughout the period  
- Flat transaction cost per trade cycle, no slippage or execution friction included

## Known / Unknown Risks
- Synthetic price models may understate extreme volatility  
- Real-world conditions like liquidity, margin changes, and rebalancing cycles are not represented

## Lifecycle Mapping
| **Goal**                          | **Stage** | **Deliverable**                          |
